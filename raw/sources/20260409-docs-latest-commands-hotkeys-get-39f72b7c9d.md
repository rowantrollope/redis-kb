```Returns tracking results and metadata from the current or most recent hotkeys tracking session.

This command returns comprehensive information about the hotkeys tracking session, including:

- Tracking metadata (start time, duration, sample ratio, etc.)
- Performance statistics (CPU time, network bytes)
- Lists of top K hot keys sorted by the metrics specified in `HOTKEYS START`

The following metrics are collected for non-clustered as well as clustered Redis environments:

- `tracking-active` (integer): 1 if tracking is active, 0 if stopped
- `sample-ratio` (integer): The sampling ratio used during tracking
- `selected-slots` (array): [Array]() of select slots and slot ranges
- `all-commands-all-slots-us` (integer): CPU time in microseconds for all commands on all slots
- `net-bytes-all-commands-all-slots` (integer): Network bytes for all commands on all slots
- `collection-start-time-unix-ms` (integer): Unix timestamp in milliseconds when tracking started
- `collection-duration-ms` (integer): Duration of tracking in milliseconds
- `total-cpu-time-user-ms` (integer): User CPU time used in milliseconds (only when the `CPU` metric was specified with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `total-cpu-time-sys-ms` (integer): System CPU time used in milliseconds (only when the `CPU` metric was specified with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `total-net-bytes` (integer): Total network bytes processed (only when the `NET` metric was specified with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `by-cpu-time-us` (array): [Array]() of key-time pairs sorted by CPU time in microseconds (only when the `CPU` metric was specified with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `by-net-bytes` (array): [Array]() of key-bytes pairs sorted by network bytes (only when the `NET` metric was specified with `HOTKEYS START`)

The following additional results are collected only on clustered Redis environments, when `SLOTS` was used with `HOTKEYS START`:

- `sampled-commands-selected-slots-us` (integer): CPU time in milliseconds for sampled commands in selected slots (only when `SAMPLE` was used with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `all-commands-selected-slots-us` (integer): CPU time in milliseconds for all commands in selected slots
- `net-bytes-sampled-commands-selected-slots` (integer): Network bytes for sampled commands in selected slots (only when `SAMPLE` was used with `HOTKEYS START`)
- `net-bytes-all-commands-selected-slots` (integer): Network bytes for all commands on selected slots
