```The `XGROUP DELCONSUMER` command deletes a consumer from the consumer group.

Sometimes it may be useful to remove old consumers since they are no longer used.

Note, however, that any pending messages that the consumer had will become unclaimable after it was deleted.
It is strongly recommended, therefore, that any pending messages are claimed or acknowledged prior to deleting the consumer from the group.
