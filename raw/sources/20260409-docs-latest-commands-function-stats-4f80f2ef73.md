```Return information about the function that's currently running and information about the available execution engines.

The reply is map with two keys:

1. `running_script`: information about the running script.
  If there's no in-flight function, the server replies with a _nil_.
  Otherwise, this is a map with the following keys:
  * **name:** the name of the function.
  * **command:** the command and arguments used for invoking the function.
  * **duration_ms:** the function's runtime duration in milliseconds.
2. `engines`: this is a map of maps. Each entry in the map represent a single engine.
   Engine map contains statistics about the engine like number of functions and number of libraries.

You can use this command to inspect the invocation of a long-running function and decide whether kill it with the [`FUNCTION KILL`]() command.

For more information please refer to [Introduction to Redis Functions]().
