Connect your Rust application to a Redis database using the redis-rs client library.

## Overview

redis-rs is a high-performance Redis client for Rust that leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs with excellent integration into the Rust ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents memory leaks and data races
- **High Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient memory usage
- **Async Support**: Tokio integration for asynchronous, non-blocking operations
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with compile-time error checking
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management for concurrent applications
- **Pipeline Support**: Command batching for improved throughput
- **Cluster Support**: Redis Cluster client for distributed setups
- **Comprehensive API**: Full Redis command coverage with idiomatic Rust interfaces

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Rust Redis documentation](https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/) to install, connect, and use redis-rs.
