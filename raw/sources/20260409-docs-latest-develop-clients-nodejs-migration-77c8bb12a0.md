Redis previously recommended the [`ioredis`]()
client library for development with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en),
but this library is now deprecated in favor of
[`node-redis`](). This guide
outlines the main similarities and differences between the two libraries.
You may find this information useful if you are an `ioredis` user and you want to
start a new Node.js project or migrate an existing `ioredis` project to `node-redis`.

## Comparison of `ioredis` and `node-redis`

The tables below summarize how `ioredis` and `node-redis` implement some
key features of Redis. See the following sections for more information about
each feature.

### Connection

| Feature | `ioredis` | `node-redis` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [Initial connection](#initial-connection) | Happens when you create a client instance | Requires you to call a method on the client instance |
| [Reconnection after a connection is lost](#reconnection) | Automatic by default | Automatic by default and configurable |
| [Connection events](#connection-events) | Emits `connect`, `ready`, `error`, and `close` events | Emits `connect`, `ready`, `error`, `end`, and `reconnecting` events |

### Command handling

## Details

The sections below explain the points of comparison between `ioredis` and
`node-redis` in more detail.

### Initial connection

`ioredis` makes the connection to the Redis server when you create an instance
of the client object:

```js
const client = require('ioredis');

// Connects to localhost:6379 on instantiation.
const client = new Redis();
```

`node-redis` requires you to call the `connect()` method on the client object
to make the connection:

```js
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient();
await client.connect(); // Requires explicit connection.
```

### Reconnection after a connection is lost {#reconnection}

Both `ioredis` and `node-redis` automatically attempt to reconnect if the connection
was lost due to an error. `node-redis` also lets you add a custom reconnection strategy
when you create the client object. See
[Reconnect after disconnection]()
for more information.

### Connection events

The `connect`, `ready`, `error`, and `close` events that `ioredis` emits
are equivalent to the `connect`, `ready`, `error`, and `end` events
in `node-redis`, but `node-redis` also emits a `reconnecting` event.
See [Connection events]()
for more information.

### Command case

Command methods in `ioredis` are always lowercase. With `node-redis`, you can
use uppercase or camel case versions of the method names.

```js
// ioredis
client.hset('key', 'field', 'value');

// node-redis
client.HSET('key', 'field', 'value');

// ...or
client.hSet('key', 'field', 'value');
```

### Command argument handling

`ioredis` parses command arguments to strings and then passes them to
the server, in a similar way to [`redis-cli`]().

```js
// Equivalent to the command line `SET key 100 EX 10`.
client.set('key', 100, 'EX', 10);
```

Arrays passed as arguments are flattened into individual elements and
objects are flattened into sequential key-value pairs:

```js
// These commands are all equivalent.
client.hset('user', {
    name: 'Bob',
    age: 20,
    description: 'I am a programmer',
});

client.hset('user', ['name', 'Bob', 'age', 20, 'description', 'I am a programmer']);

client.hset('user', 'name', 'Bob', 'age', 20, 'description', 'I am a programmer');
```

`node-redis` uses predefined formats for command arguments. These include specific
classes for commmand options that generally don't correspond to the syntax
of the CLI command. Internally, `node-redis` constructs the correct command using
the method arguments you pass:

```js
// Equivalent to the command line `SET bike:5 bike EX 10`.
client.set('bike:5', 'bike', {EX: 10});
```

### Asynchronous command result handling {#async-result}

All commands for both `ioredis` and `node-redis` are executed
asynchronously. `ioredis` supports both callbacks and
[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
return values to respond to command results:

```js
// Callback
client.get('mykey', (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(result);
  }
});

// Promise
client.get('mykey').then(
    (result) => {
        console.log(result);
    },
    (err) => {
        console.error(err);
    }
);
```

`node-redis` supports only `Promise` objects for results, so
you must always use a `then()` handler or the
[`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to receive them. However, you can still use callbacks with the legacy mode if you need them:

```js
// Promise
await client.set('mykey', 'myvalue');

// Callback
const legacyClient = client.legacy();
legacyClient.set("mykey", "myvalue", (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(result);
  }
});
```

### Arbitrary command execution

`ioredis` lets you issue arbitrary commands in a similar format to
[`redis-cli`]() using the `call()`
command:

```js
await client.call('JSON.SET', 'doc', "$", '{"f1": {"a":1}, "f2":{"a":2}}');
```

In `node-redis`, you can get the same effect outside a transaction using `sendCommand()`:

```js
await client.sendCommand(['hset', 'hash2', 'number', '3']);
```

Within a transaction, use `addCommand()` to include arbitrary commands. Note that
you can freely mix `addCommand()` calls with standard commands in the same
transaction:

```js
const responses = await client.multi()
  .addCommand(['hset', 'hash3', 'number', '4'])
  .hGet('hash3', 'number')
  .exec();
```

### Pipelining

Both `ioredis` and `node-redis` will pipeline commands automatically if
they are executed in the same "tick" of the
[event loop](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick#what-is-the-event-loop)
(see
[Execute a pipeline]()
for more information).

You can also create a pipeline with explicit commands in both clients.
With `ioredis`, you use the `pipeline()` command with a chain of
commands, ending with `exec()` to run the pipeline:

```js
// ioredis example
client.pipeline()
    .set('foo', '1')
    .get('foo')
    .set('foo', '2')
    .incr('foo')
    .get('foo')
    .exec(function (err, results) {
      // Handle results or errors.
    });
```

For `node-redis`, the approach is similar, except that you call the `multi()`
command to start the pipeline and `execAsPipeline()` to run it:

```js
client.multi()
    .set('seat:3', '#3')
    .set('seat:4', '#4')
    .set('seat:5', '#5')
    .execAsPipeline()
    .then((results) => {
        // Handle array of results.
    },
    (err) => {
        // Handle errors.
    });
```

### Scan iteration

`ioredis` supports the `scanStream()` method to create a readable stream
from the set of keys returned by the [`SCAN`]()
command:

```js
const client = new Redis();
// Create a readable stream (object mode)
const stream = client.scanStream();
stream.on('data', (resultKeys) => {
  // `resultKeys` is an array of strings representing key names.
  // Note that resultKeys may contain 0 keys, and that it will sometimes
  // contain duplicates due to SCAN's implementation in Redis.
  for (let i = 0; i < resultKeys.length; i++) {
    console.log(resultKeys[i]);
  }
});
stream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('all keys have been visited');
});
```

You can also use the similar `hscanStream()`, `sscanStream()`, and
`zscanStream()` to iterate over the items of a hash, set, or sorted set,
respectively.

`node-redis` handles scan iteration using the `scanIterator()` method
(and the corresponding `hscanIterator()`, `sscanIterator()`, and
`zscanIterator()` methods). These return a collection object for
each page scanned by the cursor (this can be helpful to improve
efficiency using [`MGET`]() and
other multi-key commands):

```js
for await (const keys of client.scanIterator()) {
  const values = await client.mGet(keys);
  // Process values...
}
```

### Subscribing to channels

`ioredis` reports incoming pub/sub messages with a `message`
event on the client object (see
[Publish/subscribe]() for more
information about messages):

```js
client.on('message', (channel, message) => {
   console.log(Received message from ${channel}: ${message});
});
```

With `node-redis`, you use the `subscribe()` command to register the
message callback. Also, when you use a connection to subscribe, that
connection can't issue any other commands, so you must create a
dedicated connection for the subscription. Use the `client.duplicate()`
method to create a new connection with the same settings as the original:

```js
const subscriber = client.duplicate();
await subscriber.connect();

await subscriber.subscribe('channel', (message) => {
   console.log(Received message: ${message});
});
```

### `SETNX` command

`ioredis` implements the  [`SETNX`]()
command with an explicit method:

```js
client.setnx('bike:1', 'bike');
```

`node-redis` provides a `SETNX` method but this command is deprecated. Use the `NX` option to the [`SET`]()
command to get the same functionality as `SETNX`:

```js
await client.set('bike:1', 'bike', {'NX': true});
```

### `HMSET` command

The [`HMSET`]() command has been deprecated
since Redis v4.0.0, but it is still supported by `ioredis`. With `node-redis`
you should use the [`HSET`]() command with
multiple key-value pairs. See the [`HSET`]()
command page for more information.

### `CONFIG` command

`ioredis` supports a `config()` method to set or get server configuration
options:

```js
client.config('SET', 'notify-keyspace-events', 'KEA');
```

`node-redis` doesn't have a `config()` method, but instead supports the
standard commands [`configSet()`](),
[`configGet()`](),
[`configResetStat()`](), and
[`configRewrite`]():

```js
await client.configSet('maxclients', '2000');
```
