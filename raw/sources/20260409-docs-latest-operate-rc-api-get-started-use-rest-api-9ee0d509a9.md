```You can access and use the API endpoint URI ([`https://api.redislabs.com/v1`](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/)) with any of the following tools:
- The Swagger user interface
- The cURL HTTP client
- An HTTP client in any programming language


For the Redis Cloud API, there is a request limit of 400 requests per minute per Account API key. If you go past this limit, your API requests will fail.


## Swagger user interface

The [Swagger UI](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/swagger-ui.html) is useful for initial introduction and for learning about API operations, models, and simulated usage.

### Authenticate to Swagger

To authenticate to the Swagger UI:

1. Open the [Swagger UI](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/swagger-ui.html) page in a browser.

    

1. Select `Authorize`.

    The **Available Authorizations** box is shown with the headers and values that are used for authentication in all API interactions with Swagger.

    

1. Insert the API Key values:

    1. Enter the [Account Key]() as the `x-api-key` value and then choose **Authorize**.
    1. Enter the [Secret Key]() as the `x-api-secret-key` value and then choose **Authorize**.
    1. Select **Close**.


The key values are not saved when you refresh the page.


When authorization is successful, the lock icon displays a closed lock.



### Make API requests

After you complete the authorization in the Swagger UI, you can make an API request:

1. Open an action category and select an API operation.

    For example, in the `Account` category select the `GET /payment-methods` operation.

    

1. Select **Try it out** and then select **Execute**.

    The API response is shown in the **Responses** section of the API operation.
    The results include an example of how to execute the same operation in a standard command-line utility using `cURL`.

    

#### Inputs for operations in Swagger

Some API operations require input, such as:

- **Parameters** - When an API operation requires URI parameters, such as "get subscription by subscription id", you can enter the values for the parameters.

    

- **JSON Request Body** - For API operations that require a JSON request body, you can either:

    - Use the **model display** to write the request based on the expected JSON structure and parameters.

        

    - Use the **Try it now** sample JSON created by Swagger as a base template that you can edit and execute.

        


The Swagger UI generates default JSON examples for `POST` and `PUT` operations. You should modify these examples to suit your specific needs and account settings. The examples will fail if used as-is. <br/><br/>For more examples showing how to use specific endpoints, see [REST API examples]().


## Use the `cURL` HTTP client

`cURL` is a popular command line tool used to perform HTTP requests,
either as individual commands or within shell scripts (such as bash and zsh).
For an introduction, see [How to start using cURL and why: a hands-on introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-start-using-curl-and-why-a-hands-on-introduction-ea1c913caaaa/).


Our examples use `cURL` and Linux shell scripts to demonstrate the API; you can use any standard REST client or library.<br/><br/>
Our examples also use `jq`, [a JSON parser](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  Use your package manager to install it  (Example: `sudo apt install jq`)


For example, a standard API call to get System Log information looks like this in `cURL`:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://$HOST/logs" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ACCOUNT_KEY" \
    -H "x-api-secret-key: $SECRET_KEY" \
    | jq -r .
```

- The example expects several variables to be set in the Linux shell:

    - **$HOST** - The URI of the REST API host (`api.redislabs.com/v1`)
    - **$ACCOUNT_KEY** - The [account key value]()
    - **$SECRET_KEY** - The personal [secret key value]()

- The line "`| jq -r .`" means that the HTTP response will be piped (forwarded) to the `jq` JSON parser, and it will display only the raw output ("`-r`") of the root element ("`.`")
- You can set the variables using shell commands like the following:

```shell

```
