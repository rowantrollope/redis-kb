```In Redis Cluster, each node keeps track of which master is serving
a particular hash slot.

The `CLUSTER DELSLOTS` command asks a particular Redis Cluster node to
forget which master is serving the hash slots specified as arguments.

In the context of a node that has received a `CLUSTER DELSLOTS` command and
has consequently removed the associations for the passed hash slots,
we say those hash slots are *unbound*. Note that the existence of
unbound hash slots occurs naturally when a node has not been
configured to handle them (something that can be done with the
[`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`]() command) and if it has not received any information about
who owns those hash slots (something that it can learn from heartbeat
or update messages).

If a node with unbound hash slots receives a heartbeat packet from
another node that claims to be the owner of some of those hash
slots, the association is established instantly. Moreover, if a
heartbeat or update message is received with a configuration epoch
greater than the node's own, the association is re-established.

However, note that:

1. The command only works if all the specified slots are already
associated with some node.
2. The command fails if the same slot is specified multiple times.
3. As a side effect of the command execution, the node may go into
*down* state because not all hash slots are covered.

## Example

The following command removes the association for slots 5000 and
5001 from the node receiving the command:

    > CLUSTER DELSLOTS 5000 5001
    OK

## Usage in Redis Cluster

This command only works in cluster mode and may be useful for
debugging and in order to manually orchestrate a cluster configuration
when a new cluster is created. It is currently not used by `redis-cli`,
and mainly exists for API completeness.
