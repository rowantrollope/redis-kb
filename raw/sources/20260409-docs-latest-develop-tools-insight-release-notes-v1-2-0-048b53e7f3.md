## RedisInsight v1.2.0 release notes

### Headlines

- This release improves overall stability and provides fixes for issues found after the previous release.
- Added support for Client side TLS authentication.
- Resolved bug which caused blank pages at startup.

### Details

- New features:
    - Core:
        - Added support for Redis databases that require TLS client authentication (as in Redis Software)
    - RedisTimeseries:
        - Initial `auto-updating` functionality when the query's end timestamp is `+`
- Minor Enhancements:
    - Core:
        - Check whether the port is available before starting.
        - Made `localhost` the default host instead of `0.0.0.0`.
        - Improved logging during startup.
    - RedisGraph:
        - Fixed height of query cards.
    - RediSearch:
        - Add support for zero-length and whitespace-only index names.
- Bug Fixes:
    - Core:
        - Moved server to another thread instead of a separate process.
        In certain situations, the server process was being orphaned after the main process died. This resulted in a several issues, of which the "blank page issue" was the most common. Now that the server process is in a thread instead of a process, the server is not left running when the process exits.
    - RediSearch:
        - Fixed several bugs in the display of summarized results in the table view.
    - Browser:
        - Better handling of unsupported values - link to other tools that support it or show better error message.
        - Fixed UI issues when the screen size is varied to provide better responsiveness.
