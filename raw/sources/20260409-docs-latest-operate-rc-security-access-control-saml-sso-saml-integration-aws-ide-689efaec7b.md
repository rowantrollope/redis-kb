This guide shows how to configure [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) as a SAML single sign-on identity provider (IdP) for your Redis Cloud account.

To learn more about Redis Cloud support for SAML, see [SAML single sign-on]().

Before completing this guide, you must [verify ownership of any domains]() you want to associate with your SAML setup.

## Step 1: Setup your identity provider (IdP)

### Create the AWS IAM Identity Center SAML application

1. Sign in to your AWS account.

1. From the main menu, search for **IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)**.

    

1. Once in IAM Identity Center, select **Applications**.

   

1. Next, select **Add application**.

   

1. In the next screen, select **Add custom SAML 2.0 application** then **Next**.

   

1. The **Configure Application** screen is where you initially get the information needed to configure SAML in Redis Cloud. To begin, change the **Display name** and **Description** to **Redis Cloud**.

   

1. Next, scroll to the **IAM Identity Center metadata** section. Here, you will find all of the information needed to configure SAML in Redis Cloud:

* IAM Identity Center sign-in URL
* IAM Identity Center SAML issuer URL
* IAM Identity Center Certificate

Note down or copy the URLs and select **Download** to download the certification information.


Both the IAM Identity Center sign-in URL and the IAM Identity Center SAML issuer URL are the same value. This is expected.


   


## Step 2: Configure SAML support in Redis Cloud

Now that you have your IAM Identity Center IdP server information, configure support for SAML in Redis Cloud.

### Sign in to Redis Cloud

Sign in to your account on the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io/#/login).

### Activate SAML in Access Management

To activate SAML, you must have a local user (or social sign-on user) with the `owner` role. If you have the correct permissions, you will see the **Single Sign-On** tab.

1. Add the information you saved previously in the **Configuration setup** screen. This includes:

   * **Issuer (IdP Entity ID)**: IAM Identity Center SAML issuer URL.
   * **IdP server URL**: IAM Identity Center sign-in URL.
   * **Assertion signing certificate**: Drag and drop the certificate file you downloaded to disk in the form text area.

     

   Select **Enable** and wait a few seconds for the status to change.

1. Select **Download** to get the service provider (SP) metadata. Save the file to your local hard disk.

   

1. Open the file in any text editor. Save the following text from the metadata:

   * **EntityID** - The unique name of the service provider (SP).

     

   * **Location** : The location of the assertion consumer service.

      

## Step 3: Finish SAML configuration in AWS IAM Identity Center's Redis Cloud Application

1. Return to the **Configuration setup** screen in IAM identity Center. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Upload application SAML metadata file**. Select **upload** and choose the file that you downloaded in the SAML configuration screen in Redis Cloud. 

   

1. If you would like to also configure an IdP initiated workflow, fill in the **relay state** field in the **Application properties** section. Use this URL: `https://cloud.redis.io/#/login/?idpId=XXXXXX`. Take the ID from the location URL in step 3 (the content after the last forward slash "/") and append to the URL.

   

1. Select **Submit** to finish creating the application.

   

1. Configure the **Redis Cloud** application's attribute mappings. Select **Actions > Edit Attribute Mappings**. 

      

   In the next screen, add these attributes:

   * **Subject**: `${user:email}`, `unspecified`
   * **Email**: `${user:email}`, `unspecified`
   * **FirstName**: `${user:givenName}`, `unspecified`
   * **LastName**: `${user:familyName}`, `unspecified`
   * **redisAccountMapping**: `XXXXXXX=owner`, `unspecified`

The `redisAccountMapping` key-value pair consists of the lowercase role name (owner, member, manager, billing_admin, or viewer) and your Redis Cloud Account ID found in the [account settings]().



## Step 4: Ensure that the Cloud account user has an IAM Identity Center user account

To complete SAML setup, ensure that the user who began SAML configuration in Redis Cloud console has a user defined in the AWS IAM identity center. This user account is required to complete the SAML setup.

Also, make sure that the user has been assigned to the **Redis Cloud** Application.

## Step 5: Activate SAML integration

The final step in our SAML integration with AWS IAM identity Center is to activate the SAML integration. 

1. In the Single Sign-On screen, select **Activate**.

   

  A logout notification screen displays, letting you know that you will be redirected to your identity provider. Select **Continue** to go to the AWS IAM Identity Center's login screen.

1. Enter your AWS IAM Identity Center credentials.

   

If everything is configured correctly, you will see the the Redis Cloud console screen. Your local account is now considered a SAML account. 

To log in to the Redis Cloud console from now on, click on **Sign in with SSO**.
