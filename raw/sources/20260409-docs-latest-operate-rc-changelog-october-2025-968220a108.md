## New features

### Data Integration

Redis Cloud now supports [Redis Data Integration (RDI)]() to create data pipelines that ingest data from a supported primary database to Redis. 

Using a data pipeline lets you have a cache that is always ready for queries. RDI Data pipelines ensure that any changes made to your primary database are captured in your Redis cache within a few seconds, preventing cache misses and stale data within the cache. 

See [Data Integration]() to learn how to set up data pipelines with Redis Cloud.

## Security fixes

Redis Cloud has already been updated with a patches for the following vulnerabilities: 

- (CVE-2025-49844) A Lua script may lead to remote code execution
- (CVE-2025-46817) A Lua script may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE
- (CVE-2025-46818) A Lua script can be executed in the context of another user
- (CVE-2025-46819) LUA out-of-bound read

No further action is required at this time.
