This command's behavior varies in clustered Redis environments. See the [multi-key operations]() page for more information.



`BZPOPMAX` is the blocking variant of the sorted set [`ZPOPMAX`]() primitive.

It is the blocking version because it blocks the connection when there are no
members to pop from any of the given sorted sets.
A member with the highest score is popped from first sorted set that is
non-empty, with the given keys being checked in the order that they are given.

The `timeout` argument is interpreted as a double value specifying the maximum
number of seconds to block. A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

See the [BZPOPMIN documentation][cb] for the exact semantics, since `BZPOPMAX`
is identical to [`BZPOPMIN`]() with the only difference being that it pops members
with the highest scores instead of popping the ones with the lowest scores.

## Examples

```
redis> DEL zset1 zset2
(integer) 0
redis> ZADD zset1 0 a 1 b 2 c
(integer) 3
redis> BZPOPMAX zset1 zset2 0
1) "zset1"
2) "c"
3) "2"
```

## Return information

**RESP2:**

One of the following:
* [Nil reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#bulk-strings): when no element could be popped and the _timeout_ expired.
* [Array reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#arrays): the keyname, popped member, and its score.

**RESP3:**

One of the following:
* [Null reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#nulls): when no element could be popped and the _timeout_ expired.
* [Array reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#arrays): the keyname, popped member, and its score.
