```Remove the specified members from the set stored at `key`.
Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored.
If `key` does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns
`0`.

An error is returned when the value stored at `key` is not a set.

## Examples


SADD myset "one"
SADD myset "two"
SADD myset "three"
