```## Overview

This is a maintenance release of Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes 6.2.18-41 that adds supports for Redis Enterprise 6.2.18-72.

New images and fixes are listed below. Refer to [6.2.18-41 (Dec 2022]() for compatibility notes and known limitations.

 Due to a change in the SCC, on OpenShift clusters running version 6.2.12 or earlier upgrading to version 6.2.18 or later, where `node:1` is <b>not</b> the master node, the upgrade might get stuck.

For more info and steps to prevent this issue, see [upgrade a Redis Enterprise cluster (REC)]().
