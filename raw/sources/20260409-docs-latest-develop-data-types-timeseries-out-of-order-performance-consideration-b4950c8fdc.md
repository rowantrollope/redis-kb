When an older timestamp is inserted into a time series, the chunk of memory corresponding to the new sampleâs time frame will potentially have to be retrieved from the main memory (you can read more about these chunks [here](https://redislabs.com/blog/redistimeseries-ga-making-4th-dimension-truly-immersive/)). When this chunk is a compressed chunk, it will also have to be decoded before we can insert/update to it. These are memory-intensiveâand in the case of decoding, compute-intensiveâoperations that will influence the overall achievable ingestion rate. 


Ingest performance is critical for us, which pushed  us to assess and be transparent about the impact of the out-of-order backfilled ratio on our overall high-performance TSDB.


To do so, we created a Go benchmark client that enabled us to control key factors that dictate overall system performance, like the out-of-order ratio, the compression of the series, the number of concurrent clients used, and command pipelining. For the full benchmark-driver configuration details and parameters, please refer to this [GitHub link](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/redistimeseries-ooo-benchmark).


Furthermore, all benchmark variations were run on Amazon Web Services instances, provisioned through our benchmark-testing infrastructure. Both the benchmarking client and database servers were running on separate c5.9xlarge instances. The tests were executed on a single-shard setup, with RedisTimeSeries version 1.4.


Below you can see the correlation between achievable ops/sec and out-of-order ratio for both compressed and uncompressed chunks.


## Compressed chunks out-of-order/backfilled impact analysis

With compressed chunks, given that a single out-of-order datapoint implies the full decompression from double delta of the entire chunk, you should expect higher overheads in out-of-order writes. 

As a rule of thumb, to increase out-of-order compressed performance, reduce the chunk size as much as possible. Smaller chunks imply less computation on double-delta decompression and thus less overall impact, with the drawback of smaller compression ratio.

The graphs and tables below make these key points:

- If the database receives 1% of out-of-order samples with our current default chunk size in bytes (4096) the overall impact on the ingestion rate should be 10%.

- At larger out-of-order percentages, like 5%, 10%, or even 25%, the overall impact should be between 35% to 75% fewer ops/sec. At this level of out-of-order percentages, you should really consider reducing the chunk size.

- We've observed a maximum 95% drop in the achievable ops/sec even at 99% out-of-order ingestion. (Again, reducing the chunk size can cut the impact in half.)







## Uncompressed chunks out-of-order/backfilled impact analysis

As visible on the charts and tables below, the chunk size does not affect the overall out-of-order impact on ingestion (meaning that if I have a chunk size of 256 bytes and a chunk size of 4096 bytes, the expected impact that out-of-order ingestion is the sameâas it should be). 
Apart from that, we can observe the following key take-aways:

- If the database receives 1% of out-of-order samples, the overall impact in ingestion rate should be low or even unmeasurable.

- At higher out-of-order percentages, like  5%, 10%, or even 25%, the overall impact should be 5% to 19% fewer ops/sec.

- We've observed a maximum 45% drop in the achievable ops/sec, even at 99% out-of-order ingestion.
