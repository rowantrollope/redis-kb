### Highlights

RedisTimeSeries 1.6 adds support for aggregating across multiple time series (multi-key). Before this version, queries such as "the maximum observed value of a set of time series" needed to be calculated client-side. Such queries can now be computed server-side, leveraging the heart of RedisGears ([LibMR](https://github.com/RedisGears/LibMR)) for clustered databases.

### What's new in 1.6

- Introduction ofÂ `GROUPBY`Â andÂ `REDUCE`Â inÂ `TS.MRANGE`Â and `TS.MREVRANGE` to add support for "multi-key aggregation" and support for such aggregations spanning multiple shards, leveraging [LibMR](https://github.com/RedisGears/LibMR). Currently, we supportÂ `min`,Â `max`, andÂ `sum`Â as reducers and grouping by a label.

- [#722](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/722), [#275](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/275)Â Filter results usingÂ `FILTER_BY_TS`Â by providing a list of timestamps andÂ `FILTER_BY_VALUE`Â by providing a `min` and a `max` value (`TS.RANGE`, `TS.REVRANGE`, `TS.MRANGE`, and `TS.MREVRANGE`).

- [#603](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/603),Â [#611](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/611),Â [#841](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/841)Â Introduction ofÂ TS.DELÂ which allows deleting samples in a time series within two timestamps (inclusive).

- [#762](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/762)Â Limit the number of returned labels in the response of read commands (`TS.MRANGE`, `TS.MREVRANGE`, and `TS.MGET`) usingÂ `SELECTED_LABELS`. This can be a significant performance improvement when returning a large number of series.

- [#655](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/655),Â [#801](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/801)Â Ability toÂ align the aggregation bucketsÂ with the requested start, end, or specific timestamp onÂ aggregation queries using `ALIGN` (`TS.RANGE`, `TS.REVRANGE`, `TS.MRANGE`, and `TS.MREVRANGE`).

- [#675](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/675)Â Add keyspace notifications for all CRUD commands. Check outÂ [this test](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/blob/master/tests/flow/test_ts_keyspace.py)Â for the details.

- [#882](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/882) [Auto Tiering ](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/databases/redis-on-flash//#:~:text=Redis%20on%20Flash%20%20offers,dedicated%20flash%20memory%20(SSD).) support.
