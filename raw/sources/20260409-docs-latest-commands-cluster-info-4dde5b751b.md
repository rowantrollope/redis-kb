````CLUSTER INFO` provides [`INFO`]() style information about Redis Cluster vital parameters.
The following fields are always present in the reply:

```
cluster_state:ok
cluster_slots_assigned:16384
cluster_slots_ok:16384
cluster_slots_pfail:0
cluster_slots_fail:0
cluster_known_nodes:6
cluster_size:3
cluster_current_epoch:6
cluster_my_epoch:2
cluster_stats_messages_sent:1483972
cluster_stats_messages_received:1483968
total_cluster_links_buffer_limit_exceeded:0
```

* `cluster_state`: State is `ok` if the node is able to receive queries. `fail` if there is at least one hash slot which is unbound (no node associated), in error state (node serving it is flagged with FAIL flag), or if the majority of masters can't be reached by this node.
* `cluster_slots_assigned`: Number of slots which are associated to some node (not unbound). This number should be 16384 for the node to work properly, which means that each hash slot should be mapped to a node.
* `cluster_slots_ok`: Number of hash slots mapping to a node not in `FAIL` or `PFAIL` state.
* `cluster_slots_pfail`: Number of hash slots mapping to a node in `PFAIL` state. Note that those hash slots still work correctly, as long as the `PFAIL` state is not promoted to `FAIL` by the failure detection algorithm. `PFAIL` only means that we are currently not able to talk with the node, but may be just a transient error.
* `cluster_slots_fail`: Number of hash slots mapping to a node in `FAIL` state. If this number is not zero the node is not able to serve queries unless `cluster-require-full-coverage` is set to `no` in the configuration.
* `cluster_known_nodes`: The total number of known nodes in the cluster, including nodes in `HANDSHAKE` state that may not currently be proper members of the cluster.
* `cluster_size`: The number of master nodes serving at least one hash slot in the cluster.
* `cluster_current_epoch`: The local `Current Epoch` variable. This is used in order to create unique increasing version numbers during fail overs.
* `cluster_my_epoch`: The `Config Epoch` of the node we are talking with. This is the current configuration version assigned to this node.
* `cluster_stats_messages_sent`: Number of messages sent via the cluster node-to-node binary bus.
* `cluster_stats_messages_received`: Number of messages received via the cluster node-to-node binary bus.
* `total_cluster_links_buffer_limit_exceeded`: Accumulated count of cluster links freed due to exceeding the `cluster-link-sendbuf-limit` configuration.

The following atomic slot migration fields may be included in the reply (available since Redis 8.4.0):

* `cluster_slot_migration_active_tasks`: Number of in-progress ASM tasks. Currently, it will be 1 or 0.
* `cluster_slot_migration_active_trim_running`: Number of active trim jobs in progress and scheduled.
* `cluster_slot_migration_active_trim_current_job_keys`: Number of keys scheduled for deletion in the current trim job.
* `cluster_slot_migration_active_trim_current_job_trimmed`: Number of keys already deleted in the current trim job.
* `cluster_slot_migration_stats_active_trim_started`: Total number of trim jobs that have started since the process began.
* `cluster_slot_migration_stats_active_trim_completed`: Total number of trim jobs completed since the process began.
* `cluster_slot_migration_stats_active_trim_cancelled`: Total number of trim jobs cancelled since the process began.

The following message-related fields may be included in the reply if the value is not 0:
Each message type includes statistics on the number of messages sent and received.
Here are the explanation of these fields:

* `cluster_stats_messages_ping_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_ping_received`: Cluster bus PING (not to be confused with the client command [`PING`]()).
* `cluster_stats_messages_pong_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_pong_received`: PONG (reply to PING).
* `cluster_stats_messages_meet_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_meet_received`: Handshake message sent to a new node, either through gossip or [`CLUSTER MEET`]().
* `cluster_stats_messages_fail_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_fail_received`: Mark node xxx as failing.
* `cluster_stats_messages_publish_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_publish_received`: Pub/Sub Publish propagation, see [Pubsub]().
* `cluster_stats_messages_auth-req_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_auth-req_received`: Replica initiated leader election to replace its master.
* `cluster_stats_messages_auth-ack_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_auth-ack_received`: Message indicating a vote during leader election.
* `cluster_stats_messages_update_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_update_received`: Another node slots configuration.
* `cluster_stats_messages_mfstart_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_mfstart_received`: Pause clients for manual failover.
* `cluster_stats_messages_module_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_module_received`: Module cluster API message.
* `cluster_stats_messages_publishshard_sent` and `cluster_stats_messages_publishshard_received`: Pub/Sub Publish shard propagation, see [Sharded Pubsub]().

More information about the Current Epoch and Config Epoch variables are available in the [Redis Cluster specification document]().
