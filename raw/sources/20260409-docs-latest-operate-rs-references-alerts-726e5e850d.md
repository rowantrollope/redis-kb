Cluster alerts are triggered based on thresholds applied to these stored metrics.

## Cluster alerts

In **ClusterÂ >Â Alert Settings**, you can enable alerts for node or cluster events, such as high memory usage or throughput.

Configured alerts are shown:

- As a notification on the status icon (  ) for the node and cluster
- In the **log**
- In email notifications, if you configure [email alerts](#send-alerts-by-email)


If you enable alerts for "Node joined" or "Node removed" actions,
you must also enable "ReceiveÂ email alerts" so that the notifications are sent.


To enable alerts for a cluster:

1. In **Cluster > Alert Settings**, click **Edit**. 
1. Select the alerts that you want to show for the cluster and click **Save**.

## Database alerts

For each database, you can enable alerts for database events, such as high memory usage or throughput.

Configured alerts are shown:

- As a notification on the status icon (  ) for the database
- In the **log**
- In emails, if you configure [email alerts](#send-alerts-by-email)

To enable alerts for a database:

1. In **Configuration** for the database, click **Edit**.
1. Select the **Alerts** section to open it.
1. Select the alerts that you want to show for the database and click **Save**.

## Send alerts by email

To send cluster and database alerts by email:

1. In **Cluster > Alert Settings**, click **Edit**.
1. Select **Set an email** to configure the [email server settings]().
1. In **Configuration** for the database, click **Edit**.
1. Select the **Alerts** section to open it.
