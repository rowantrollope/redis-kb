```The `CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE` command is similar to the [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`]() command in that they both remove hash slots from the node.
The difference is that [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`]() takes a list of hash slots to remove from the node, while `CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE` takes a list of slot ranges (specified by start and end slots) to remove from the node.

## Example

To remove slots 1 2 3 4 5 from the node, the [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`]() command is:

    > CLUSTER DELSLOTS 1 2 3 4 5
    OK

The same operation can be completed with the following `CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE` command:

    > CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE 1 5
    OK

However, note that:

1. The command only works if all the specified slots are already associated with the node.
2. The command fails if the same slot is specified multiple times.
3. As a side effect of the command execution, the node may go into *down* state because not all hash slots are covered.

## Usage in Redis Cluster

This command only works in cluster mode and may be useful for
debugging and in order to manually orchestrate a cluster configuration
when a new cluster is created. It is currently not used by `redis-cli`,
and mainly exists for API completeness.
