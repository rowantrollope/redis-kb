You need to set up your Redis Cloud database before you can set it as the vector database in Amazon Bedrock. To do this, you need to:

1. [Sign up for Redis Cloud and create a database](#sign-up-create-subscription)
1. [Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the database and save the certificates](#get-certs)
1. [Store database credentials in AWS secrets manager](#store-secret)
1. [Create a vector index in your database](#create-vector-index) for Bedrock to use

After you set up the database, you can use the database information to set it as your knowledge base database when you [create a knowledge base]().

## Sign up and create a database  {#sign-up-create-subscription}

To set up a Redis Cloud instance for Bedrock, you need to:

1. [Sign up for Redis Cloud](#sign-up) if you do not already have an account.
1. [Create a database](#create-sub) to use for your Bedrock knowledge base.

### Sign up for Redis Cloud using AWS Marketplace {#sign-up}

1.  Select the [Redis Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-mwscixe4ujhkq?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) AWS marketplace link from Bedrock to be taken to the Redis Cloud plan listing.

    

1.  Subscribe to Redis Cloud listing, locate the **Set Up Your Account** button, and then select it to begin mapping your Redis Cloud account with your AWS Marketplace account.

    

1.  Sign in to the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io).

1.  Select the Redis account to be mapped to your AWS Marketplace account and confirm that your payment method will change and that the connection cannot be undone.

    

1.  Use the **Map account** button to confirm your choice.

1.  Once your Redis account is mapped to your AWS Marketplace account, a message appears in the upper, left corner of the account panel.

    

    In addition, AWS Marketplace is reported as the selected payment method.

### Create a database {#create-sub} 

1. In the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io/), select **New database**. 

    

1. When the **New database** page appears, select **Pro** to create a Pro plan.

    

1. After you select **Pro**, the **Database settings** section will appear. For this guide, continue with **Easy create** to get started faster.

    

    If you'd like to select all of the configuration options yourself, select **Custom settings**. See [Create a Redis Cloud Pro database]() for more details.

1. Redis will generate a database name for you. If you want to change it, you can do so in the **Database name** field.

    

1. Select **Amazon Web Services** as the cloud vendor and select a region.

1. In the **Database Sizing** section:

    
 
    - Select [**High availability**]() if it is not already selected.
    - Set the Dataset size of your database based on the amount of data that Bedrock will pull from your Simple Storage Service (S3) [bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html). See [Find out the size of your S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/find-out-the-size-of-your-amazon-s3-buckets/) to find out how much knowledge base data is stored in your S3 bucket and pick the closest size, rounded up, from the table below. 

        | Total Size of Documents in S3 | Database size without replication | Database size with replication |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 10,000 kb                     | 135 Mb                             | 270 Mb                         |
| 100,000 kb                    | 1.35 Gb                            | 2.7 Gb                         |
| 1,000,000 kb                  | 13.5 Gb                              | 27 Gb                          |
| 10,000,000 kb                 | 135 Gb                             | 270 Gb                         |

        For more information on sizing, see the [Bedrock integration blog post](https://redis.io/blog/amazon-bedrock-integration-with-redis-enterprise/#right-size-your-database-for-amazon-bedrock).

1. Select **View all settings** to review the database settings that we selected for you.

    

    If you want to change these settings, select [**Switch to custom settings**]().

1. You will not need to enter a payment method, as it's automatically assigned to your AWS Marketplace account. Select **Confirm & pay** to create your new database.

    

    Note that databases are created in the background.  While they are provisioning, you aren't allowed to make changes.  (The process generally takes 10-15 minutes.)

    Use the **Databases list** to check the status of your subscription.  You will also receive an email when your database is ready to use.

## Enable TLS and get certificates {#get-certs}

For your database to be fully secure, you must enable [Transport Layer Security (TLS)]() for your database with client authentication.

1. Select **Databases** from the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io/) menu and then select your database from the list.

1. From the database's **Configuration** screen, select the **Edit** button:

    

1. In the **Security** section, use the **Transport layer security (TLS)** toggle to enable TLS:

    

1. Select **Download server certificate** to download the Redis Cloud certificate bundle `redis_ca.pem`:

    

1. Select the **Mutual TLS (require client authentication)** checkbox to require client authentication.

1. Select **Add client certificate** to add a certificate.

    

1. Either provide an [X.509 client certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) or chain in PEM format for your client or select **Generate** to create one:

    

    - If you generate your certificate from the Redis Cloud console, a **Download certificate** button will appear after it is generated. Select it to download the certificate. 

        
        
        The download contains:

        - `redis-db-<database_id>.crt` â the certificate's public key.

        - `redis-db-<database_id>.key` â the certificate's private key.

        
You must download the certificate using the button at this point.  After your changes have been applied, the full bundle of public and private keys will no longer be available for download.
        
    
    - If you provide a client certificate, you will see the certificate details before you save your changes.

        

1. To apply your changes and enable TLS, select the **Save database** button:

    

## Store database credentials in AWS secrets manager {#store-secret}

In the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), use the **Services** menu to locate and select **Security, Identity, and Compliance** > **Secrets Manager**. [Create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html) of type **Other type of secret** with the following key/value fields:

- `username`: Database username
- `password`: Database password
- `serverCertificate`: Contents of the [server certificate]() (`redis_ca.pem`)
- `clientCertificate`: Contents of the client certificate (`redis_user.crt`)
- `clientPrivateKey`: Contents of the client private key (`redis_user_private.key`)

After you store this secret, you can view and copy the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#iam-resources) of your secret on the secret details page. 

## Create a vector index in your database {#create-vector-index}

After your Redis Cloud database is set up, create a search index with a vector field using [FT.CREATE]() as your knowledge base for Amazon Bedrock. You can accomplish this using **Redis Insight** or `redis-cli`.

### Redis Insight

[Redis Insight]() is a free Redis GUI that allows you to visualize and optimize your data in Redis. 

To create your vector index in Redis Insight:

1. [Download and install Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight/) if you don't have it already.

1. In the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io/), in your database's **Configuration** tab, select the **Connect** button next to your database to open the connection wizard.

    

1. In the connection wizard, under **Redis Insight Desktop**, select **Public Endpoint**. Select **Open with Redis Insight** to connect to the database with Redis Insight.

1. Select **Use TLS**. In the **CA Certificate** section, select **Add new CA certificate**. Give the certificate a name in the **Name** field, and enter the contents of `redis_ca.pem` into the **Certificate** field.

    

1. Select **Requires TLS Client Authentication**. In the **Client Certificate** section, select **Add new certificate**. Give the certificate a name in the **Name** field. Enter the contents of `redis_user.crt` into the **Certificate** field, and the contents of `redis_user_private.key` into the **Private Key** field.

    

1. Select **Add Redis Database** to connect to the database.

1. Select your database alias to connect to your database. Select the **Workbench** icon to go to the workbench.

    

1. Enter the [FT.CREATE]() command to create an index. 

    ```text
    FT.CREATE <index_name>                    
        ON HASH                
        SCHEMA
            "<text_field>" TEXT
            "<metadata_field>" TEXT                   
            "<vector_field>"  VECTOR FLAT     
                6                          
                "TYPE" "FLOAT32"            
                "DIM" 1536                   
                "DISTANCE_METRIC" "COSINE"  
    ```

    Replace the following fields:

    - `<index_name>` with the vector index name
    - `<text_field>` with the text field name
    - `<metadata_field>` with the metadata field name
    - `<vector_field>` with the vector field name

1. Select **Run** to create the index.

    

### `redis-cli`

The [`redis-cli`]() command-line utility lets you connect and run Redis commands directly from the command line. To use `redis-cli`, you can [install Redis]().

Public endpoint and port details are available from the **Databases** list or the database's **Configuration** screen. Select **Connect** to view how to connect to your database with `redis-cli`.

```sh
redis-cli -h <endpoint> -p <port> --tls --cacert redis_ca.pem \
    --cert redis_user.crt --key redis_user_private.key
```

After you are connected with `redis-cli`, create an index using [FT.CREATE](). 

```text
FT.CREATE <index_name>                    
    ON HASH                
    SCHEMA
        "<text_field>" TEXT
        "<metadata_field>" TEXT                   
        "<vector_field>"  VECTOR FLAT     
            6                          
            "TYPE" "FLOAT32"            
            "DIM" 1536                   
            "DISTANCE_METRIC" "COSINE"  
```

Replace the following fields:
- `<index_name>` with the vector index name
- `<text_field>` with the text field name
- `<metadata_field>` with the metadata field name
- `<vector_field>` with the vector field name

## Next steps

After your Redis database is set up, you can use it to [create a knowledge base]() in Amazon Bedrock.
