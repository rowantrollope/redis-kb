<a name="active-active"></a>

Geo-distributed databases that span multiple [Redis Enterprise Software]() [clusters](). Active-Active databases, also known as conflict-free replicated databases (CRDB), depend on [multi-primary replication]() and [conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)]() to power a simple development experience for geo-distributed applications.

More info: [Active-Active geo-distributed Redis](), [Geo-distributed Active-Active Redis applications](), [Developing applications for Active-Active databases]()



A "member database" of a global [Active-Active database]() which is made up of its own master and replica [shards]() spanning a single [cluster]().

More info: [Active-Active database instances]()



Provides applications read-only access to replicas of the data set from different geographical locations. The Redis Enterprise implementation of active-passive [replication]() is called [Replica Of]().

More info: [Database replication](), [Replica Of]()



Each node runs a web server that is used to provide the user with access to the Redis Enterprise Software admin console (previously known as management UI). The admin console allows viewing and managing the entire [cluster](), so it does not matter which [node]() is used to access it.

More info: [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)



When features are removed from our products, they're generally replaced by new features that provide a better experience, more functionality, improved security, and other benefits.

To provide a transition period, we mark older features as _deprecated_ when introducing replacement features.  This gives you time to adjust your deployments, apps, and processes to support the new features.  During this transition, the older features continue to work as a courtesy.

Eventually, older features are removed from the product.  When this happens, they're considered _obsolete_, partly because they can no longer be used.

For best results, we advise against relying on deprecated features for any length of time.
