Configuration fields for probabilistic data structures.

| Field | Type/Value | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| bf-error-rate | number (range: 0-1) (default: 0.01) | Error ratio for new Bloom filters. These defaults are applied to each new Bloom filter upon its creation. |
| bf-initial-size | integer (range: 1-1048576) (default: 100) | Initial capacity for new Bloom filters. These defaults are applied to each new Bloom filter upon its creation. |
| bf-expansion-factor | integer (range: 0-32768) (default: 2) | Expansion factor for new Bloom filters. These defaults are applied to each new Bloom filter upon its creation. |
| cf-initial-size | integer (range: 1-1048576) (default: 1024) | Initial capacity for new Cuckoo filters. These defaults are applied to each new Cuckoo filter upon its creation. |
| cf-bucket-size | integer (range: 1-255) (default: 2) | Number of items in each bucket for new Cuckoo filters. These defaults are applied to each new Cuckoo filter upon its creation. |
| cf-max-iterations | integer (range: 1-65535) (default: 20) | Maximum iterations for new Cuckoo filters. These defaults are applied to each new Cuckoo filter upon its creation. |
| cf-expansion-factor | integer (range: 0-32768) (default: 1) | Expansion factor for new Cuckoo filters. These defaults are applied to each new Cuckoo filter upon its creation. |
| cf-max-expansions | integer (range: 1-65536) (default: 32) | Maximum expansions for new Cuckoo filters. These defaults are applied to each new Cuckoo filter upon its creation. |
