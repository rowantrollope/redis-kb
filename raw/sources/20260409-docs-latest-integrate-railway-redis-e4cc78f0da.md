[Railway](https://railway.com?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=redis) simplifies your infrastructure stack from databases to servers to observability with a single, scalable, easy-to-use platform. Companies of all sizes deploy full-stack applications on Railway and benefit from highly performant networking, intuitive vertical and horizontal scaling, and isolated environments with pull request deploys. Railway's template marketplace includes thousands of one-click deploy templates, including Redis.



This is a guide to deploying Redis on Railway, using the official template.

## Deploy Redis to Railway

Navigate to a new Railway project at [railway.com/new](https://railway.com/new?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=redis). Add a Redis database to your project via the `ctrl / cmd + k` menu, and type `Redis`.

You can also deploy it via the [template](https://railway.com/deploy/redis) from the Railway template marketplace.



Upon deployment, you will have a Redis service running in your project, deployed from the [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) Docker image.

Since the deployed container is pulled from the [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) image in Docker Hub, you can modify the deployment based on the [instructions in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis).

## Connecting to your Railway Redis Service

It is possible to connect to Redis externally by using the [TCP Proxy](https://docs.railway.com/deploy/exposing-your-app#tcp-proxying?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=redis) which is enabled by default.

## Backup and Monitoring

Especially for production environments, performing backups and monitoring the health of your data is essential. Consider adding:

- **Backups**: Automate regular backups to ensure data recovery in case of failure. We suggest checking out Railway's native [Backups](https://docs.railway.com/reference/backups?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=redis) feature.

- **Observability**: Implement monitoring for insights into performance and health of your Redis cluster. You can integrate a Redis exporter for Prometheus, although we do not provide a specific template at this time.
