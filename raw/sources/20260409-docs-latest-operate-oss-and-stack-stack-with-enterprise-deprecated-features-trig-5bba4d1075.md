The triggers and functions feature of Redis Stack allows running JavaScript functions inside Redis. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger.

## Quick links
* [Command documentation](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/tree/master/docs/commands)
* [Source code](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears)
* [Latest release](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases)
* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server/)

## Primary features

* JavaScript engine for functions
* On-demand functions
* Keyspace triggers
* Stream triggers
* Async handling of functions
* Read data from across the cluster

## Cluster support

Triggers and functions support deployment and execution of functions across a cluster. Functions are executed on the correct shard based on the key that is changed or read functions can be executed on all to return a correct view of the data.
